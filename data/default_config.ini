[TOP-LEVEL PARAMETERS]
; Options: 	FULLY_INTRINSIC (compiles bitstreams to circuits and runs on the FPGA)
;				- Used to actually run on the hardware
;			SIM_HARDWARE (compiles the bitstreams and arbitrarily evaluates their fitness all on the computer)
;				- Used for testing the evolutionary functions and well as how crossover/mutation performs on the files
;			FULLY_SIM (generates sine waves that can be treated like variance measure outputs)
;				- Used for testing the evolutionary method and variance fitness functions, not ensuring mutation and crossover are functional on the files
;           INTRINSIC_SENSITIVITY (runs the same circuit repeatedly to measure how fitness changes)
; We recommend not using any of the modes other than FULLY_INTRINSIC unless you are modifying code and testing it
simulation_mode = FULLY_INTRINSIC
; This defines the base config file for this config file. If any parameters are missing from this file,
; they will be pulled from the base file
;base_config = path/to/config

[FITNESS PARAMETERS]
; Options:	VARIANCE (uses the variance fitness function)
;			SENSITIVE_PULSE_COUNT (uses the pulse count fitness function) - this function is more flat with a sharp peak
;           TOLERANT_PULSE_COUNT (uses the pulse count fitness function) - this function is more bell-shaped
;			COMBINED (uses variance and closeness to trigger voltage)
;           PULSE_CONSISTENCY (uses pulse count self-consistency fitness function - should be used with multiple passes)
; This is independent of the data measured from the MCU, and only defines how that data should be handled
; (Note: For backwards compatibility, the PULSE_COUNT option is still included. It will use the SENSITIVE_PULSE_COUNT function)
fitness_func = VARIANCE
desired_freq = 10000
; Options:  ADD (adds the two fitness measures together with weighting)
;			MULT (multiplies the two fitness measures together)
combined_mode = MULT
pulse_weight = 2
var_weight = 0
; Number of samples to record in pulse count fitness functions
; The minimum number recorded will be used to determine the actual pulse fitness
; Higher number of samples will take longer to run, but should result in more stable circuits
num_samples = 1
; Number of passes to go through each circuit in a single generation
; This means it will evaluate circuit 1, 2, 3, ... and then 1, 2, 3, ... again
; The lowest fitness from these overall passes will be used
; Total samples recorded in each generation is num_samples * num_passes * population_size
num_passes = 1

[GA PARAMETERS]
population_size = 50
mutation_probability = 0.0021
crossover_probability = 0.7
elitism_fraction = 0.1
; Options:	SINGLE_ELITE (top individual is an elite)
;			FRAC_ELITE (uses the elitism_fraction to determine number of elites)
;			CLASSIC_TOURN (runs a classic tournament)
;			FIT_PROP_SEL (fitness-proportional selection)
;			RANK_PROP_SEL (rank-proportional selection)
;			MAP_ELITES (MAP-elites inspired method, maps waveforms to a grid and copies/mutates the best in each cell for the next generation) - not defined for SIM_HARDWARE or PULSE measurement
selection = FIT_PROP_SEL
; Options:	HAMMING_DIST (uses the average Hamming distance as the diversity measure)
;			UNIQUE (uses the count of unique individuals as the diversity measure)
diversity_measure = HAMMING_DIST
random_injection = 0.0

[INITIALIZATION PARAMETERS]
; Options:	CLONE_SEED (clones the seed hardware to every individual in the population) - not defined for FULLY_SIM
;			CLONE_SEED_MUTATE (clones the seed hardware to every indvidual, and then mutates each of them) - not defined for FULLY_SIM
;			RANDOM (completely randomizes the [modifiable] bitstream of all individuals)
;			EXISTING_POPULATION (uses the existing population as-is) - not defined for FULLY_SIM
init_mode = CLONE_SEED_MUTATE
; Options:	PULSE (until pulses detected)
;			VARIANCE (until variance crosses certain threshold)
;			NO (no randomization, just begin evolution immediately)
randomize_until = NO
randomize_threshold = 4
; Options:	RANDOM (completely randomize every circuit until you get a desired fitness result)
;			MUTATE (mutate each circuit once until you get a desired fitness result)
; Note: Randomization goes through the population. Therefore, if doing MUTATE with CLONE_SEED and pop size = 50, for example,
; there will be 50 mutations of the original circuit, then each of those will be mutated (building off of the first mutation)
; until a desired result is seen
randomize_mode = RANDOM

[STOPPING CONDITION PARAMETERS]
; Can provide a value or IGNORE for generations & target_fitness
; If IGNORE is provided, will not take target fitness/# generations into account
; Will stop when it reaches one of these; whichever comes first
