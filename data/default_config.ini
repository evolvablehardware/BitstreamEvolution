[GA PARAMETERS]
population_size = 50
; Can provide a value or NONE for generations & target_fitness
; If NONE is provided, will not take target fitness/# generations into account
; Will stop when it reaches one of these; whichever comes first
; If both are set to NONE, then evolution will run until the user forces it to stop
generations = 500
target_fitness = NONE
genotypic_length = 24
mutation_probability = 0.0021
crossover_probability = 0.7
elitism_fraction = 0.1
desired_freq = 10000
; Options:	SINGLE_ELITE (top individual is an elite)
;			FRAC_ELITE (uses the elitism_fraction to determine number of elites)
;			CLASSIC_TOURN (runs a classic tournament)
;			FIT_PROP_SEL (fitness-proportional selection)
;			RANK_PROP_SEL (rank-proportional selection)
;			MAP_ELITES (MAP-elites inspired method, maps waveforms to a grid and copies/mutates the best in each cell for the next generation) - not defined for SIM_HARDWARE or PULSE measurement
selection = FIT_PROP_SEL
; Options:	PULSE (until pulses detected)
;			VARIANCE (until variance crosses certain threshold)
;			NO (no randomization, just begin evolution immediately)
randomize_until = PULSE
variance_threshold = 4
; Options:	CLONE_SEED (clones the seed hardware to every individual in the population) - not defined for FULLY_SIM
;			CLONE_SEED_MUTATE (clones the seed hardware to every indvidual, and then mutates each of them) - not defined for FULLY_SIM
;			RANDOM (completely randomizes the [modifiable] bitstream of all individuals)
;			EXISTING_POPULATION (uses the existing population as-is) - not defined for FULLY_SIM
init_mode = CLONE_SEED
; Options: 	FULLY_INTRINSIC (compiles bitstreams to circuits and runs on the FPGA)
;				- Used to actually run on the hardware
;			SIM_HARDWARE (compiles the bitstreams and arbitrarily evaluates their fitness all on the computer)
;				- Used for testing the evolutionary functions and well as how crossover/mutation performs on the files
;			FULLY_SIM (generates sine waves that can be treated like variance measure outputs)
;				- Used for testing the evolutionary method and variance fitness functions, not ensuring mutation and crossover are functional on the files
; We recommend not using any of the modes other than FULLY_INTRINSIC unless you are modifying code and testing it
simulation_mode = FULLY_INTRINSIC
; Options:	HAMMING_DIST (uses the average Hamming distance as the diversity measure)
;			UNIQUE (uses the count of unique individuals as the diversity measure)
diversity_measure = HAMMING_DIST
; Options:	VARIANCE (uses the variance fitness function)
;			PULSE_COUNT (uses the pulse count fitness function)
;			COMBINED (uses variance and closeness to trigger voltage)
; This is independent of the data measured from the MCU, and only defines how that data should be handled
fitness_func = PULSE_COUNT
; Options:	AVG (uses the average of all samples)
;			OUTLIERS (takes the average of all samples after removing those that are more than 2 standard deviations from the mean)
;			MEDIAN (uses the median of all samples)
;			PERCENTAGE (removes the top and bottom 10% of samples and returns the mean)
sampling_method = MEDIAN
; Options:	ADC (takes 500 voltage samples over 5ms)
;			PULSE_COUNT (counts the number of pulses that cross a threshold over 1s)
;			PULSE_WIDTH
measurement_type = PULSE_COUNT
num_samples = 2
random_injection = 0.0

[FITNESS FUNC PARAMETERS]
; Options:  ADD (adds the two fitness measures together with weighting)
;			MULT (multiplies the two fitness measures together)
