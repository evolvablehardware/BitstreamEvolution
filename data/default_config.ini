population_size = 50
generations = 500
genotypic_length = 24
mutation_probability = 0.0021
crossover_probability = 0.7
elitism_fraction = 0.1
desired_freq = 10000
; Options:	SINGLE_ELITE (top individual is an elite)
;			FRAC_ELITE (uses the elitism_fraction to determine number of elites)
;			CLASSIC_TOURN (runs a classic tournament)
;			FIT_PROP_SEL (fitness-proportional selection)
;			RANK_PROP_SEL (rank-proportional selection)
selection = FIT_PROP_SEL
randomize_until = PULSE
variance_threshold = 4
; Options:	CLONE_SEED (clones the seed hardware to every individual in the population)
;			CLONE_SEED_MUTATE (clones the seed hardware to every indvidual, and then mutates each of them)
;			RANDOM (completely randomizes the [modifiable] bitstream of all individuals)
;			EXISTING_POPULATION (uses the existing population as-is)
init_mode = CLONE_SEED
pulse_func = True
; Options: 	FULLY_INTRINSIC (compiles bitstreams to circuits and runs on the FPGA)
;				- Used to actually run on the hardware
;			SIM_HARDWARE (compiles the bitstreams and arbitrarily evaluates their fitness all on the computer)
;				- Used for testing the evolutionary functions and well as how crossover/mutation performs on the files
;			FULLY_SIM (uses arbitrary bitstreams - not in files - and arbitrarily evaluates their fitness)
;				- Used for testing the evolutionary method only, not ensuring mutation and crossover are functional on the files
; We recommend not using any of the modes other than FULLY_INTRINSIC unless you are modifying code and testing it
simulation_mode = FULLY_INTRINSIC
; Options:	HAMMING_DIST (uses the average Hamming distance as the diversity measure)
;			UNIQUE (uses the count of unique individuals as the diversity measure)
diversity_measure = HAMMING_DIST
; Options:	VARIANCE (uses the variance fitness function)
;			PULSE_COUNT (uses the pulse count fitness function)
; This is independent of the data measured from the MCU, and only defines how that data should be handled
fitness_func = PULSE_COUNT
measurement_type = PULSE_WIDTH
num_samples = 2
