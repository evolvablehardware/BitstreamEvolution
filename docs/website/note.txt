This is an idea for the directory structure of the high-level documentation we want available. 
These aren't for tests, like the build infrastructure will be. These are specifically configured outputs that should automatically generated from scripts, likely in the main /docs directory.

This file should hold only the main-user focused documentation website that we hope to emphasize to the general audience.

All test files meant to be used should get their own directories in the /docs directory and scripts to generate them, and those that aren't should be in the git ignored docs/sphinx/build folder.
