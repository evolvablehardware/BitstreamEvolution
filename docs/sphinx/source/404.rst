404 Error

========================================
Oops... We can't find the URL requested. 
========================================

Isn't this interesting. We are usually are able to find all of the pages we have available.

.. warning ::
    Look for something that exists next time.


.. todo ::
    For some reason when you look for a page not in the main directory, when this 404 page appears, there is no formatting.
    The whole page pops up properly except for the formatting. If I were to guess it is likely because of how Sphinx builds 
    the html and how github is grabbing the html file for use. It might make sense to build a custom 404 file in html that links 
    outward instead of dealing with this, and just figure out how to put it in the gh-pages repository.
