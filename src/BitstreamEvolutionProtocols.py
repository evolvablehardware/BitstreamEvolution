# - Also in that case, we need a way to link those to Circuits, or have a way to transmit the filepaths to the hardware file between Individual and Circuit
#   - Could just get copied in CircuitFactory for when there's a 1-to-1 relationship between Individuals and Circuits
# Only thing is I think we need some protocol for taking/collecting a measurement. Potentially replacing the "data_request" field in Measurement
# - This would have diff. implementations for VarMax, PulseCount, ToneDiscrimination, etc.
# - Not 100% sure on the interface for this, it should take in one or more Measurements and compute their results, and take in
