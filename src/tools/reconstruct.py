'''
reconstruct.py - current state
==============================
This is a test piece of code that is currently not used, and was an exploratory plan that was put to the side due to storage space conserns.

program goal
============
This program is for reconstructing a generation, from another file
This will build all of the circuit files from a generation file, and put them in 
the ASC directory

Args: generation number to reconstruct
The code will use the config file for the paths to the ASC directory and generations directory
But, it will use the config values provided in the generation files for the routing and accessible columns
