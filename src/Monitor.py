"""
Monitor - NOT USED
------------------

Comments left describing previous use case:
- currently not being used for anything.
- This process was originally luanched by Logger
- The Logger class logged a header and then 23 ".\n" to the file
- Now, the Logger also handles logging to a log file specified by the config, so I don't think this class is needed
